            <p>Hey, I’m <strong>Chris Rauch</strong> — a U.S. Naval Officer turned Software 
                Engineer passionate about building robust, scalable solutions that solve 
                real-world problems.</p>
        
            <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
                Cal Poly Pomona</a> in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science, building my foundation in 
                software engineering and design. Shortly after, I commissioned as a U.S. Naval Officer 
                and spent the next four years leading high-performing teams and managing complex operations 
                in fast-paced, high-stakes environments. From managing 
                multi-billion dollar overhead strategic assets to overseeing Department of Defense security 
                programs while forward deployed, I bring leadership, risk management, and mission-critical 
                decision-making experience to every project.</p>
        
            <p>Today, I leverage both my technical expertise and leadership experience to build full-stack applications,
                automate workflows, and design systems that are not only functional, but maintainable and scalable. 
                My work spans backend services, cloud infrastructure, hardware integration, and automation — with 
                an eye always on simplicity, performance, and real-world impact.</p>
        
            <p>If you're looking for a versatile engineer who can operate under pressure, adapt quickly, and deliver 
                high-quality solutions — let’s build something together.</p>
